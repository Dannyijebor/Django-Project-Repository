# Django Project Repository  

## Overview  
This repository contains a **Django-based web application**, structured with a robust settings configuration and essential project components. It serves as a foundational setup for a **scalable web application** that follows Django’s best practices, including security, database management, middleware configuration, and static file handling.  

## Features  
- **Django Framework**: Leverages Django’s built-in authentication, session management, and admin panel.  
- **Modular Structure**: Well-organized directory structure with `INSTALLED_APPS` including `myapp` for custom application logic.  
- **Security Enhancements**: Implements CSRF protection, X-Frame-Options middleware, and password validation mechanisms.  
- **Database Support**: Uses SQLite by default but can be extended for PostgreSQL or MySQL.  
- **Template System**: Supports Django’s templating engine with customizable template directories.  
- **Static Files Management**: Configured for handling CSS, JavaScript, and image assets efficiently.

## Setup Instructions  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  
   cd your-repo  
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**  
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
4. **Run database migrations:**  
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate  
   ```
5. **Start the development server:**  
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver  
   ```
6. **Access the application:**  
   Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in a web browser.  

## Configuration  
- Modify `settings.py` for **production settings**, including `DEBUG=False` and configuring `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.  
- Set up a **strong SECRET_KEY** in an environment variable for security.  
- Replace SQLite with **PostgreSQL/MySQL** in `DATABASES` settings for scalability.
